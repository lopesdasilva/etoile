				About &eacute;toile <br>
				<small>Enhanced Technology for Open Intelligent Learning
					Environments</small>
			</h2>

		</div>

		<p>Complex systems science is highly interdisciplinary. The
			silo-based education provided by most universities creates scientists
			expert in one discipline but ignorant of most others. Most PhD
			programmes require students to learn key ideas from other disciplines
			relevant to their topic, but knowledge across the community is
			patchy. This includes basic social science and even the core
			disciplines of mathematics, statistics, physics and ICT. The Complex
			Systems Society (CSS, 2000+ members) has identified this as a major
			hindrance to the development of the science.</p>
		<p>We will develop and use a remarkable new way of automatically
			creating educational resources. It is scalable so that the cost of
			educating large numbers of students is very low. It is adaptive to
			changes in the curriculum in fast-moving research fields creating new
			learning resources as new topics emerge, and it is adaptive to
			students by creating learning resource that reflects their personal
			styles of learning, background knowledge, and language. Étoile is a
			big step towards personalised learning.</p>
		<p>The basic étoile concept is simple but a demonstrator is needed
			to show that the idea works in practice for real students working
			towards masters and doctoral degrees. We will provide an open source
			implementation for use by the CSS, and other organisation needing to
			disseminate new ideas quickly at low cost to a heterogeneous
			community.</p>
		<p>Following proof of concept, the CSS will take étoile forward in
			its long term programme of professional training and recognition.
			Students with certificated mastery of the core curriculum will be
			highly attractive as post-docs. As mastery of the core curriculum
			becomes common communication in the research community will be much
			easier, there will be less duplication of effort and more
			cross-fertilization of ideas. Étoile can have big and long-lasting
			impact on the science of complex systems, and the method can be
			adopted by other fast-moving research communities.</p>
